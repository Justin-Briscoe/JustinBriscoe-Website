        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Justin Briscoe and I am currently a student at the University of California Riverside. I grew up in Yucaipa which is around thirty minutes from Riverside. My parents had a good amount of influence on me as I grew up. They were the type of parents who would not do things for you and instead would tell you how to do it, and watch you try it yourself and if I did not get it the first time they would make me try again.<br><br>

        Growing up with parents like this often had me making decisions on my own. I did have two older brothers, however they did not take the college path out of high school like I had planned to. So senior year I had to look at schools myself and make the decision as well as apply to all these different schools on my own and hope for the best. Not to mention it was also during covid which only made things more difficult. I also played sports during my time in high school as well as in college. Playing sports teaches you how to work with a team and what it feels like to have others relying on you. I was captain of the cross country and track team in high school so I learned a good bit of what it takes to be a leader and how to maintain a positive attitude when things would become tough.<br><br>

        I did end up at the University of California Riverside and am currently enjoying my stay here. The classes are challenging to the point where I feel rewarded for my efforts and not too overworked. I Have learned a lot of skills throughout my lifetime and particularly my time at UCR. A few of these skills being working well with others, time management, and having a positive attitude so as to be a good influence on those around me.
